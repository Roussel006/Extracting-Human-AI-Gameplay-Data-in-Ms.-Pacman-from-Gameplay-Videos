We present a code to extract gameplay information (all states and actions) in Ms. Pacman from videos of gameplay. We demonstrate the code on the Atari-HEAD dataset by Zhang et al (2020) that provides the gameplay information as a series of images (AKA, "videos").

The extracted gameplay data and all data from the Atari-HEAD dataset were combined into one datafile, which can be found here: https://osf.io/rd35j/
